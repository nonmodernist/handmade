<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first stage of the <i>Making A Website</i> series. As you can see, this page is extremely basic. It's being built by <a href="https://nonmodernist.com">Alex</a> as a test to see if hand coding a website can accomplish a specific goals, without adding all the unnecessary crap that the project doesn't need and won't use.</p>
<p>At this point, I am adding a <b>tiny</b> little bit of css to make it look nicer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is a list item.</li>
  <li>Here's another.</li>
<li>Here's one more for good measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far I have added a color palette and a faviicon. And here I am adding <a href="example.org">a longer link to test what it looks like</a>.</p>
